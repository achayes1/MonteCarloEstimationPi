This project was written in C using a virtual machine running linux on Codio.com

This is code for using the Monte Carlo method for estimating Pi, both sequentially and in parallel.   

To run, simply access this folders directory and run the makefile, then run either of the created files followed by a problem size, and number of threads if running parallel version. The output will show the time it took and the accuracy of the estimate.
